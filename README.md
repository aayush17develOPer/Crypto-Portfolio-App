Hello, I am Aayush Joshi and this is my Crypto Portfolio App.

I have implemented following features in it:

a. Designed a carousel displaying various cryptocurrencies available.
b. Made use of coingecko API to fetch all the dynamic information automatically.
c. Made a coin table consisting on coins with their logo, symbol, name, current price, % change in 24 hours and market cap.
d. When a coin is clicked on the above table, it navigates to a page where a one-two line description of the coin is shown along with some other parameters. Also there is a historical chart of that coin below which shows a line graph of the prices of the coin vs time in 24 hours.
e. I have incoroporated a feature to connect to metamask and see the current ID's address and balance.
f. There is the facility to transfer coins from one address to another wallet address.

I have took inspiration from the following sources for making this project:
